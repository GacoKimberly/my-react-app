      <p>Hello! My name is Kimberly, and I’m currently a BSIT student with a strong interest in web development, design, and technology. I created this portfolio to document my progress and share my learning experience. Even though I’m still at the beginning of my journey, I’m dedicated to improving every day and excited about what’s ahead.</p>
<p>I believe that consistency and curiosity are the keys to growth.</p>
